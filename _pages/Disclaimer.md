## Do Your Own Research

Our content is intended to be used and must be used for information and education purposes only. It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment based on your own personal circumstances. You should take independent financial advice from a professional in connection with, or independently research and verify, any information that you find on our Website and wish to rely upon, whether for the purpose of making an investment decision or otherwise.

## No Investment Advice

Our Website is a financial data and news portal, discussion forum and content aggregator. Replica Forex is not a broker/dealer, we are not an investment advisor, we have no access to non-public information about foreign exchange data, and this is not a place for the giving or receiving of financial advice, advice concerning investment decisions or tax or legal advice. We are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority.

We are an educational community for analysing, learning & discussing general and generic information related to the foreign exchange markets, investments and strategies. No content on the site constitutes - or should be understood as constituting - a recommendation to enter in any investment transactions or to engage in any of the investment strategies presented in our site content. We do not provide personalised recommendations or views as to whether a stock or investment approach is suited to the financial needs of a specific individual.

## Individual Empowerment, Not Hand-Holding

This is the beginning of a journey, not the end. Where we present investment screens, the results should only be treated as candidates for further research, not as a buy list or set of recommendations. Screening may help to narrow a search based on pre-defined criteria but it is not a substitute for independent research reflecting your individual criteria for investing/trading.

Where we offer valuation tools, these are solely for informational & educational purposes so that users can easily run their own valuations. The pre-defined values are simply a starting point based on global assumptions that we have applied across the entire market â€“ users should amend them as they see fit and not regard them as a substitute for their own judgment. Any resulting valuation outputs are necessarily generic and are not endorsed by Replica.
