# Market Management System Example

**Below is a visual example of how the Replica Forex development team intends to execute the following market strategy.**

**1. The Pancake Swap liquidation strategy will entail the following:**
    **a. 3,500,000 RFX will be traded into the market marginally overtime. Our priority is market growth and liquidity in order to maintain interest. This is strictly for market maintenance and not for T/P. RFX Tokens will be traded for BNB in order to add liqudity to the pool.** 
    **b. 1,000,000 RFX Will be used for the development team.**
    **c. 1,000,000 RFX will be used for Fees, crypto and fiat alike.(Binance.us, Forex.com, Legal, Structure, etc.)**
    **d. 1,000,000 RFX will be used for marketing incentivization.**

**2. After step(1) above, all BNB will be moved to Binance.us for conversion.**

**3. Next, converted crypto will used for community Forex pool via Forex.com.**

**4. The principal amount + 50% of profits will remain in the pool. 50% of the profits will be removed and sent to Binance.us for BNB conversion.**

**5. Lastly, when BNB is acquired 50% of the BNB will be converted into RFX, and the other 50% will be used for liquidity.**
